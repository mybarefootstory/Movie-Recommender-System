# Movie Recommender System

## Overview

The **Movie Recommender System** is a machine learning application that provides personalized movie recommendations based on user input. By leveraging two datasets from The Movie Database (TMDB), 
this system analyzes around 5,000 movies to generate a list of the top five recommended films based on the movie name entered by the user. The application features a user-friendly interface built 
with Streamlit, allowing users to interactively explore movie recommendations.

## Features

- Predicts the top 5 movie recommendations based on user input.
- Utilizes a combination of movie metadata, including genres, keywords, cast, and crew.
- Interactive Streamlit interface for a seamless user experience.
- Data preprocessing and feature extraction to enhance recommendation accuracy.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following libraries:

- **Data Manipulation**:
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - `numpy`: For numerical operations.

- **Natural Language Processing**:
  - `nltk`: For text processing and stemming.

- **Machine Learning**:
  - `scikit-learn`: For implementing machine learning algorithms and vectorization.

- **Web Framework**:
  - `Streamlit`: For creating the web application interface.

- **Data Visualization**:
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For visualizing data insights.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommender-system.git
   cd movie-recommender-system

Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):
bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install Required Packages:
text
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
nltk
streamlit
matplotlib
seaborn

Then run:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

To run the Movie Recommender System, execute the following command in your terminal:
bash
streamlit run app.py

Once the app is running, you can enter the name of a movie in the input box, and the model will provide the top 5 recommended movies.


Workflow

Data Loading:
The project begins by loading two TMDB datasets: tmdb_5000_movies.csv and tmdb_5000_credits.csv.

Data Preprocessing:
The datasets are merged and cleaned to remove null values and duplicates.
Key features such as genres, keywords, cast, and crew are extracted and transformed into a suitable format for analysis.

Feature Engineering:
Tags are created by combining the overview, genres, keywords, cast, and crew into a single string for each movie.
Text data is processed using stemming to reduce words to their root form.

Vectorization:
The tags are vectorized using CountVectorizer to convert text data into numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

Similarity Calculation:
Cosine similarity is computed to measure the similarity between movies based on their tags.

Recommendation Function:
A recommendation function is implemented to retrieve the top 5 movies similar to the input movie based on their similarity scores.

Deployment:
The application is deployed using Streamlit, providing an interactive interface for users to get movie recommendations.
